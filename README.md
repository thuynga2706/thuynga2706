### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ I'm master student in Operations Research, specialized in Transportation and Logistics. My motivation is to make life easier with mathematics. Isn't it amazing that most of our real life problems can be mathematically formulated and solved by programs? 

ðŸŒ± Currenly I'm working on Data Analytics in Retails, and eager to apply ML algorithms in real life problems. 

âš¡ Fun fact: I have exceptional interest in food. Check [Grocery-Optimization](https://github.com/thuynga2706/Grocery-Optimization) how I use Linear Programming to minimize my pocket 

ðŸ“« If we share the same goal and interest, don't hestitate to reach me by my [email](mailto:thuynga2706@gmail.com)
